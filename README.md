# LHDM
Lawson-Hanson with Deviation Maximization

This is the companion software of the article "The Lawson-Hanson Algorithm with Deviation Maximization: Finite Convergence and Sparse Recovery" by M.Dessole, M.Dell'Orto and F.Marcuzzi

It contains:
- a main file "LHDM.m" with LHDM algorithm implementation;
- a test_driver, contained in files "main_test_driver.m" and "runner.m".

Note that the database and the other solvers, other than LHDM, must be downloaded as indicated in the paper, in a directory hierarchy and naming that is evident from the code in "main_test_driver.m".

The software is a work-in-progress and "as is", i.e. not intended for any use different from mere understanding of the method presented in the paper mentioned above.
